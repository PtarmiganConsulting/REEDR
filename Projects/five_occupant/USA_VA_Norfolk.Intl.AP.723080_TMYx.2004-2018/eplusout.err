   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = DX_COOLING_COIL but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   **   ~~~   ** CheckCurveLimitsForStandardRatings: The max and/or min limits specified in the corresponding curve objects
   **   ~~~   **  do not include the AHRI test conditions required to calculate one or more of the Standard Rating values.
   **   ~~~   ** Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed=DX_COOLING_COIL:  Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio (IEER) calculated is not at the AHRI test condition.
   **   ~~~   **  Check limits in Total Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve, Curve Type = Curve:Biquadratic, Curve Name = COOL-CAP-FT
   **   ~~~   **  Check limits in EIR Function of Temperature Curve, Curve Type = Curve:Biquadratic, Curve Name = COOL-EIR-FT
