   **   ~~~   ** User-Specified Maximum Air Flow Rate of 0.53094 [m3/s]
   **   ~~~   ** differs from Design Size Maximum Air Flow Rate of 6.86015E-002 [m3/s]
   **   ~~~   ** This may, or may not, indicate mismatched component sizes.
   **   ~~~   ** Verify that the value entered is intended and is consistent with other components.
   ** Warning ** GetDXCoils: Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed="DX_HEATING_COIL" curve values
   **   ~~~   ** ... Defrost Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name = DEFROSTEIR output is not equal to 1.0 (+ or - 10%) at rated conditions.
   **   ~~~   ** ... Curve output at rated conditions = 0.152
   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = DX_COOLING_COIL but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   **   ~~~   ** CheckCurveLimitsForStandardRatings: The max and/or min limits specified in the corresponding curve objects
   **   ~~~   **  do not include the AHRI test conditions required to calculate one or more of the Standard Rating values.
   **   ~~~   ** Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed=DX_COOLING_COIL:  Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio (IEER) calculated is not at the AHRI test condition.
   **   ~~~   **  Check limits in Total Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve, Curve Type = Curve:Biquadratic, Curve Name = COOL-CAP-FT
   **   ~~~   **  Check limits in EIR Function of Temperature Curve, Curve Type = Curve:Biquadratic, Curve Name = COOL-EIR-FT
   ** Warning ** Check input. Pump nominal power or motor efficiency is set to 0, for pump=MAINS PRESSURE
