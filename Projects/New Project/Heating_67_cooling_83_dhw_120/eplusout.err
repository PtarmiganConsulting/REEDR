   ** Severe  ** WaterHeater:Sizing object name: WATER HEATER_UNIT1 does not match any of the water heaters defined in the file
   ** Warning ** Water heater named WATER HEATERhas heater capacity set to AUTOSIZE but it is missing associated WaterHeater:Sizing object
   ** Warning ** GetAirflowNetworkInput: SurfaceAverageCalculation is entered for field = Wind Pressure Coefficient Type.
   **   ~~~   ** The AirflowNetwork model provides wind pressure coefficients for 4 vertical exterior orientations and 1 horizontal roof.
   **   ~~~   **  There are only 4 exterior surface orientations defined in this input file using AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface objects.
   **   ~~~   ** Reconsider if this is your modeling intent. Simulation continues.
   **  Fatal  ** LocalWaterTankFactory: Error getting inputs for tank named: WATER HEATER_UNIT1

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
