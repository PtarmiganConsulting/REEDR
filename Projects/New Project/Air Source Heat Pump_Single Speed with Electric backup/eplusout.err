   ** Warning ** GetAirflowNetworkInput: SurfaceAverageCalculation is entered for field = Wind Pressure Coefficient Type.
   **   ~~~   ** The AirflowNetwork model provides wind pressure coefficients for 4 vertical exterior orientations and 1 horizontal roof.
   **   ~~~   **  There are only 4 exterior surface orientations defined in this input file using AirflowNetwork:MultiZone:Surface objects.
   **   ~~~   ** Reconsider if this is your modeling intent. Simulation continues.
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = COOLING_ASHP_SS but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   **   ~~~   ** CheckCurveLimitsForStandardRatings: The max and/or min limits specified in the corresponding curve objects
   **   ~~~   **  do not include the AHRI test conditions required to calculate one or more of the Standard Rating values.
   **   ~~~   ** Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed=COOLING_ASHP_SS:  Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio (IEER) calculated is not at the AHRI test condition.
   **   ~~~   **  Check limits in Total Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve, Curve Type = Curve:Biquadratic, Curve Name = HPACCOOLCAPFT
   **   ~~~   **  Check limits in EIR Function of Temperature Curve, Curve Type = Curve:Biquadratic, Curve Name = HPACCOOLEIRFT
