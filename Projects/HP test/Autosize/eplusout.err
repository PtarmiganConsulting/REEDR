   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** ManageSizing: For a plant sizing run, there must be at least 1 Sizing:Plant object input. SimulationControl Plant Sizing option ignored.
   ** Warning ** GetDXCoils: Coil:Heating:DX:SingleSpeed="DX_HEATING_COIL" curve values
   **   ~~~   ** ... Defrost Energy Input Ratio Function of Temperature Curve Name = DEFROSTEIR output is not equal to 1.0 (+ or - 10%) at rated conditions.
   **   ~~~   ** ... Curve output at rated conditions = 0.152
   ** Warning ** SizeDXCoil Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed DX_COOLING_COIL
   **   ~~~   ** ...Gross Rated Total Cooling Capacity [W] will be limited by the maximum rated volume flow per rated total capacity ratio.
   **   ~~~   ** ...DX coil volume flow rate ( m3/s ) = 0.721250
   **   ~~~   ** ...Requested capacity ( W ) = 11494.880
   **   ~~~   ** ...Requested flow/capacity ratio ( m3/s/W ) = 6.274E-005
   **   ~~~   ** ...Maximum flow/capacity ratio ( m3/s/W ) = 6.041E-005
   **   ~~~   ** ...Adjusted capacity ( W ) = 11939.254
   ** Warning ** The Standard Ratings is calculated for Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed = DX_COOLING_COIL but not at the AHRI test condition due to curve out of bound.
   **   ~~~   **  Review the Standard Ratings calculations in the Engineering Reference for this coil type. Also, use Output:Diagnostics, DisplayExtraWarnings for further guidance.
   **   ~~~   ** CheckCurveLimitsForStandardRatings: The max and/or min limits specified in the corresponding curve objects
   **   ~~~   **  do not include the AHRI test conditions required to calculate one or more of the Standard Rating values.
   **   ~~~   ** Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed=DX_COOLING_COIL:  Integrated Energy Efficiency Ratio (IEER) calculated is not at the AHRI test condition.
   **   ~~~   **  Check limits in Total Cooling Capacity Function of Temperature Curve, Curve Type = Curve:Biquadratic, Curve Name = COOL-CAP-FT
   **   ~~~   **  Check limits in EIR Function of Temperature Curve, Curve Type = Curve:Biquadratic, Curve Name = COOL-EIR-FT

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
