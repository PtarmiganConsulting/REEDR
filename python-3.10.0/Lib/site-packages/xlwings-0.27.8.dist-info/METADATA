xlwings - Make Excel fly with Python!
=====================================

xlwings (Open Source)
---------------------

xlwings is a `BSD-licensed <http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause>`_ Python library that makes it easy to call Python from Excel and vice versa:

* **Scripting**: Automate/interact with Excel from Python using a syntax that is close to VBA.
* **Macros**: Replace your messy VBA macros with clean and powerful Python code.
* **UDFs**: Write User Defined Functions (UDFs) in Python (Windows only).

**Numpy arrays** and **Pandas Series/DataFrames** are fully supported. xlwings-powered workbooks are easy to distribute and work
on **Windows** and **macOS**.

xlwings includes all files in the xlwings package except the ``pro`` folder, i.e., the ``xlwings.pro`` subpackage.

xlwings PRO offers additional functionality on top of xlwings (Open Source), including:

* Support for Google Sheets and Excel on the web
